# cep-packager

This packager allows you to create native macOS and Windows installers for a CEP extension.
It takes a configuration file as input (it looks for in the the folder where you are running the command from) and a folder that contains the files that have to be packaged up (usually generated by `cep-bundler`).

The easiest way to use this package is to use the `cep-starter` package, which already depends on the `cep-packager` and has a default config.

However, you can also use this package standalone, for that, follow the instructions below:

## requirements

- macOS
- node.js
- homebrew
- wine
- makensis

```shell
# install homebrew
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
# install makensis
brew install wine makensis
```

## install

```shell
npm install --save cep-packager
```

## configure

- Copy the `cep-config.js` file from the `cep-starter` package into you project folder.
- Modify desired options

Run the packager:
```shell
./node_modules/.bin/cep-packager
```

Or, add to your `package.json`'s scripts section:

```json
"scripts": {
  "package": "cep-packager"
}
```

## develop

```shell
git clone https://github.com/adobe-extension-tools/cep-packager.git
cd cep-packager
npm install
npm start
```
